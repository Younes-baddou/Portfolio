       I am currently a third-year student at SUPINFO Caen, focusing on honing my engineering skills. With a growing passion for web development since entering the field of computer science, I specialize in several areas. These include PHP & Laravel for robust back-end development, HTML/CSS for crafting intuitive and responsive user interfaces, and React for transforming ideas into dynamic applications with smooth user interactions. Additionally, I have expanded my skill set to include ASP.NET for building scalable web applications, Node.js for server-side programming, Docker for containerization and deployment, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and Microsoft Azure for cloud services. Actively seeking an apprenticeship, I aim to apply my diverse skills while continuing to learn and grow in web development. I am enthusiastic about challenging projects and learning opportunities that will further my development as a web developer, emphasizing collaboration, innovation, and perseverance. I firmly believe in the importance of knowledge sharing and teamwork for producing quality solutions.
